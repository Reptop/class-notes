  Why is it important to communicate effectively?:

     Communication empowers people and can facilitate a cohesive, effective team. 

     The benefits of collaboration is highly controlled by how well a team communicates effectively.

  Technical Communication:
    communcates technical information in any medium (Technical writing is more objective and research based)

  technical writing:
    - Makes careful use of design and layout to enhance use

    - is ethical, objective, and accurate

    - upholds field/organization foals, cuture and values

    - technical writing I have encountered (programming documentation, cookbook, motherboard manual, lego instructions, khan academy, manuals) 
                                           (this seems quite broad)

  Effective communication is ALWAYS dependant on the rhetorical situation

  Rhetoricial situation:
    Message - purpose(s) of the Message

    Audience - Consumers of said message 

    Author - Who's writing it 

    Circulating everything above is the context

    Types of context:

    physical location, 
    what medium is the message, 
    culture,
    your field/discipline
    current events

    Author: 
      Education, profession, personal experience, research documentation, is the writing objective/objective - for credibility

    Message (purpose?): clarity, inform, direct/instruct/teach, persuade

    Audience: (NEEDS - what do they know, what don't they know? - What do they need from this communication)
              (When/where/why will this be used? - to finding the best medium to actually transmit this information)

              (Attitudes - preferences, likes dislikes torwards topic, attitudes torwards the author (you), your organization)

              (Values: core principles/beliefs)

      Audience profile:
        Different levels of audience: primary .... secondary

  Practicing with diffrrent audience types:

  Some common types of technical reports:

    Primary research reports:
      - Lab reports
      - Field reports
      - Progress reports
      - incident or accident reports
      - Compliance reports
      - Structural reports
    Secondary/mixed research reports 
      - Literature reviews
      - Technical background and specification reports
      - Feasibility reports (Cost-benefits)
      - Justification reports
      - Recommendation reports

      Progress reports:
        shows work that needs to be done and work that has been done. Really is just a progress report; they show progress

  short reports:
    1+ pages - not exceeding 5 
    No requirment for font or back matter
    Variable headings (depending on type / rhetorical situation)

  long report:
    in-depth, often analyitical or problem solving in nature
    Multiple audience expected (parts for different audience)
    Expected front and back matter


    common long reports:
      - letter of transmital
      - title page 
      .....

  Making an effective table:
    Generally, introduce visuals before they appear

    Assuming the table is discussed prior to table placement, table label's come first

    The denser the table gets with text the size of the table matters a lot more

  Notes on partial samples:
    could leave a note and say all these below are the same medium 

    they added parrallelism
    _______________________

    Most specific categorizations are used

    Can use numbers instead of writing them in words

    font is too small, the accessibility is affected here

  Avoiding plagarism:
    Plagarism is...
    - Copy / paste 
    - inappropriate 
    - failure to cite or to cite consistently
    - Failure to use quote marks for source

    How to avoid plagarism:
      - Give yourself time to check citations
      - Know the rules 
      - Ask questions
      - Cite not only when quoting, but also summarizing or paraphrasing
        (in engineering, we usually dont avoid quotes because you are the one thats supposed to take of that writing,
        you are the experts - quoting is info from experts. There can be exceptions though)
      - Use proper resources

      Rules of paraphrasing and summarizing:
        - CITED Need to have in intext citations and citations at the footer 
        - SENTENCE STRUCTURE Cant actually have the same sentence strucure as the original source
        - ACCURATE / OBJECTIVE 
        - IN YOUR OWN WORDS

      Paraphrasing steps:
        Read/reread until you understand

        step away from the original text 

        compose what you remember in your own words 

        compare the original with the paraphrase

        Edit any part that break the Paraphrasing rules

      Source attribution:
        - Citing 
        - Source tags in text 

        According to a 2020 pew research center survery.....

      Quotes:
        Keep quotes accurate (verbatim)

        Keep quotes short

January 22 2023:
    A signal that a quotation is coming–generally the author’s name and/or a reference to the work
    An assertion that indicates the relationship of the quotation to your text
