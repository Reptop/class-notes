  Why is it important to communicate effectively?:

     Communication empowers people and can facilitate a cohesive, effective team. 

     The benefits of collaboration is highly controlled by how well a team communicates effectively.

  Technical Communication:
    communcates technical information in any medium (Technical writing is more objective and research based)

  technical writing:
    - Makes careful use of design and layout to enhance use

    - is ethical, objective, and accurate

    - upholds field/organization foals, cuture and values

    - technical writing I have encountered (programming documentation, cookbook, motherboard manual, lego instructions, khan academy, manuals) 
                                           (this seems quite broad)
