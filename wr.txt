  Why is it important to communicate effectively?:

     Communication empowers people and can facilitate a cohesive, effective team. 

     The benefits of collaboration is highly controlled by how well a team communicates effectively.

  Technical Communication:
    communcates technical information in any medium (Technical writing is more objective and research based)

  technical writing:
    - Makes careful use of design and layout to enhance use

    - is ethical, objective, and accurate

    - upholds field/organization foals, cuture and values

    - technical writing I have encountered (programming documentation, cookbook, motherboard manual, lego instructions, khan academy, manuals) 
                                           (this seems quite broad)

  Effective communication is ALWAYS dependant on the rhetorical situation

  Rhetoricial situation:
    Message - purpose(s) of the Message

    Audience - Consumers of said message 

    Author - Who's writing it 

    Circulating everything above is the context

    Types of context:

    physical location, 
    what medium is the message, 
    culture,
    your field/discipline
    current events

    Author: 
      Education, profession, personal experience, research documentation, is the writing objective/objective - for credibility

    Message (purpose?): clarity, inform, direct/instruct/teach, persuade

    Audience: (NEEDS - what do they know, what don't they know? - What do they need from this communication)
              (When/where/why will this be used? - to finding the best medium to actually transmit this information)

              (Attitudes - preferences, likes dislikes torwards topic, attitudes torwards the author (you), your organization)

              (Values: core principles/beliefs)

      Audience profile:
        Different levels of audience: primary .... secondary

  Practicing with diffrrent audience types:
