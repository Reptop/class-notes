General principles of biochemical engineering:

Carbon cycle:
Is an example of a biogeochemical cycle

a biogeochemical cycle are the chemical reactions 

Carbon Footprint:
    The total set of greenhouse gas emissions cuased by an organization, event, or product.

    The carbon foorprint typically considers all six of the kyoto protocol greenhouse gasses. (What are kyoto protocol greenhouse gasses?)

    - Carbon dioxide
    - Methane
    - Nitrous oxide
    - Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
    - Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
    - Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)

Carbon footprinting
    US Average Person 16tons of Co2 per year
    World average person 4 tons of Co2 per year

the world average is less than average US person is because many people around the world dont live in a highly industrulized society.
