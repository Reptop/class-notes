Notes from 27 September 2022

Global warming refers the increase in the rise of global average temperature near earth's surface

Climate basics:
    The world has been gettting warmer - the co2 parts per million on our atmopsphere is significantly higher than historic levels.
 
    Another defintion: climate is the expected range of weather for someone living in a specific place
    What is Climate?
        Climate is determined by many factors that influence flows of energy through the climate system, including greenhouse gases.
        Climate change is a change in the pattern of weather - and changes in oceans, land surgaces, and ice sheets, occuring over a large time scale.

    Climate change:
    Climate change is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns. 
    (Climate = distribution of weather outcomes)

    With climate change, we are changing the normal distribution, as the statistical distribution is more saturated in higher temperatures compared to 
    previous data.

    There is not just a shift in the mean, there is also a shift in variance; the distribution are getting smushed down, so more record hot weather is
    very possible. Higher variance equates to greater unpredictabillity - less change for cold weather, but more record hot weather when the mean is shifted,
    but extreme cold and hot weather is still possible because of this increased variance.

    Essentially, this increased variance would lead to more extreme weather outcomes.

    The normal distribution can also be applied to frequency of wildfires, droughts, etc. Temperature isnt the only unit applicable to this normal disribution

Earths warming trend:
    Average temp has risen by 1.53F in last 100 years

    Projected to rise another 2F to 11.5F

Effects of Warming:
    Even small shifts in the mean and variance temperature can lead to a positive feedback loop, which in turn can lead to dangerous shifts in climate and weather

    Examples:
    - More floods, droughts, or intense rain
    - Melting of the polar ice caps
    - Rising see levels
    - Reduce in albedo effect
    - could be more...

IPCC:
    IPCC from the united nations created a model that uses rpc as a metric to detail the intesnity of climate change


Climate views in the united states over time:
    The amount of people that recognize climate change as an issue is rising; however, there are still people who are in disbelief.

"We need to add incentives to become more climate friendly. In an unregulated market nothing alligns self interest with the broader effects of society"

Current events:
    52 billion dolloar proposal to protect NYC from storm surges

Carbon is an unregulated market; we need policies to make carbon regulated

What is economy:
    A collection of technological, legal, and social arrangments through which individuals in society seek to incnrease their well-being

What is economics:
    The allocation of limited resources (money) to satisfy unlimited human wants
        - The goal of studying economics is just trying to find out how we can do better.

What is climate economics:
    The application of the principles of economics to the study of how environmental and resources are managed.

Big picture questions:
    what is the right price to put on environmental damages that impact our climate?
    What is the best approach to dealing with GHG pollution?

Two systems: economy and the climate
Economy                        climate
 - Economic Agents          - Biosphere
 - Institutions they form     - atmopsphere
 - Linkages between agents    - Flora
                              - Fauna
                              - Oceans

Climate change Mitigation:
reducing the flow of heat-trapping grenhouse gases into the atmopsphere
 This can be accomplished by:
    - Reducing the use of fossil fuels
    - Enhancing the capacity of carbon "sinks"

Mitigation policy options (Reducing the flow of GHGs):
    - Market based instruments (M) - Carbon taxes, Subsidies, Cap and trade - can influence innovation in climate friendly instruments (influence the economy)
    - Regulatory instruments (R) - Regulatory efforts, product bans, government investment (For example, a new fuel efficiency standard for cars has been placed) (Creating regulations)
    - Volutary Agreement (V) - Made bewteen a government agency and one or more private parties to acheive environmental objectives or performance

Reducing the use of fossil fuels: 
    - By taxing the use of fossil fuels and using C02 emissions market (M)
    - Improving energy efficiency (R, V)
    - Choosing renewable energy over fossil fuels (M, R, V)
    - Choosing public transport and sustainable mobillity (M, R, V)
    - Promoting sustainable changes in industries (M,R,V)

Enhancing Carbon Sinks:
    - Limiting deforestation (M, R, V)
    - Reducing soil erosion (M, R, V)
    - Habitat restoration in both terrestrial and marine environments (M, R, V)
    - Carbon capturing technology

Other mitigation options:
    - Climate engineering
     - Deliberate and large-scale interventions in climate systems

Climate change adaption:
    Adpapting to actual or expected future climate by taking practical actions to manage risks
    The goal of adaptation is to reduce our vulnerbillity to harmful effects of climate change

Adaption and adaptation types:
    When to adapt?
        - reactive (Response to event of stimulus)
            - Farmer changes crop choice after a drought destroyed crops last year
        - Anticipitory (Actions are taken before impacts are actually observed)
            - government agency providing funding to costal home owners to prevent their homes from being submerged
    Who's doing the adapting?
        - private(Only reacted by an individual and would only benefit that individual)
            - A person in portland buys an AC in response to the rise in temperatures
        - public/joint(actions that create benefits for many individuals at once)
            - engineers nourishes beaches in florida to protect homes and infrastructure from hurricanes and rising sea levels (widening beaches as a protective buffer)

Mitigation and adapting (Using both at the same time!!!!!):
    - Coastal wetland store and sequester lots of Carbon (Mitigation)
    - They defend coasts against sea level rise by buffering storm surges and floodwaters (Adaptation)

5 major challenges:
 - Large Scale & irreversibillity of damages (The large scale and irreversibillity of this issue could make change too late)
                                             (Also when GHGs are realeased in the atmopsphere, they stay for a very long time)

 - Global cooperation (Politcal battles between countries; we need global cooperation for the best policy solutions)

 - intergeneration impacts (its not going away, they want to kick costs in the future, want benefits now)
                           (How can we take into account of the people that aren't born - who are likely to experience severe effects of climate change)

 - Uncertainty (projecting how climate will change and the economics with it, is still quite uncertain in many areas)

 - Unequal distribution of impacts (Success in one place could be damaging to other areas)
                                   (Poorer, Hotter countries are more vulnerable to climate change, and will experience more negative impacts)

scale in terms of economics:
    Economic damage from climate change could reduce global GDP(Gross domestic product) by 7.2% by 2100

irreversibillity:
    Co2 concentration is largely irreversibile for 1,000 years after emissions stop, locking in:
        - Temperature increase
        - Dry season rainfall reduction
        - Sea level rise
Global cooperation:
    GHGs are uniformly-mixed pollutants (Regardless of where they came from, they mix uniformly into the atmopsphere causing problems for all)
    Countries are doing this to each other in a sense

    GLOBAL PROBLEMS REQUIRE COLLECTIVE ACTION

    Because GHGs mix globally in the atmopsphere, damage isnt necessarily attributed to the country where the emissions came from. And expenditures to reduce
    emissions may not benefit the country that is incurring (suffering) them. Therefore, countries may decide to invest in reducing poverty within their borders because 
    spending funds on climate change that will make little impact.

    Undeveloped countries are arguing that developed countries have reaped the benefits of co2 emissions are should be responsible in reducing it.

    The threat of climate change isnt as immediate, dense, or recognizable as threats have historically alligned nations behind a common purpose

intergenerational impacts:
    we would rather see the benefits now and pay for it later

    How can we enact policies today to balance the welfare effects of those alive today against the wellfare of future generations?
    (How can we make sure the earth isnt damaged to the point where it will become unlivable for future generations?)

Uncertainty:
    calls for individuals to make decisions with potentially long term consequences, with potentially incomplete knowledge of our climate systems
    We will continue to understand climate science and increases in greenhouse gases; however, there will still be many uncertainties.

    Some main uncertainties:
        - future emissions trajectories
        - future changes in societal preferences
        - modeling limitations
        - measurement error and data
        - feedback systems that could amplify or dampen disturbances in climate systems

Uncertainty could work in both directions: it could prove to be less of a disaster than expected or much, much worse.

Unequal distribution of impacts:
    - The poorest countries are experiencing the worst of climate change, which is an issue they were barely responsible for.
    - In a society where global natural resources are shared, people will look out for themselves instead of the common good, which disadvantages marginalized
      groups of people.
    - A study suggests that climate change are increased between-country inequality by about 25 percent.

    The 5 challenges of climate change summarized:
        The effects of climate change is likely to be costly, irreversibile, and unequally distrubted around the plant, and impact current and future
        generations. Defining policy goals must deal with uncertainties in future outcomes and the global nature of the problem

Why is climate change an economic problem???

    (The economy heavily relies on the burning of fossil fuels)
    Much of our economy is based on the combustion of fossil fuels, leading to Co2 emissions in our atmopsphere. This alters earth's climate via 
    the greenhouse effects, which causes feedback loops that can further amplify rising temperatures and effect on humanity. 

    The CORE ECONOMIC problem with greenhouse gas emissions is those who generate the emissions do not pay for the privilege to do so; those that are harmed
    are not compensated. 

    Since the industrial revolution, our atmopshere has been used as a free resource to absorb emissions from industrial activity.

    Using the production of corn as an example:
        When you buy corn, you are paying for the cost to produce it and farmers and retailers are compensated to provide to you - the consumer. However,
        the carbon emissions released to produce that piece of corn is not taken into account of the price of that corn. Economists call these costs 
        externalities, as they are external to the market transaction.

        Externality: Byproduct of market transaction--which is not borne by a third party--and does not participate in that transaction.

        Climate change is an externality and is likely to be the most complex externality that we face because it is global, affecting everyone on the planet,
        the effects are long lived, and that no individual slow the effects of climate change on their own.

        Climate change is an issue for two central economic reasons:
            - its a global externality created by everyday people in their burning of fossil fuels
            - Its a persistent problem that casts a long shadow into the future. The effects of emissions now are likely to affect humans and natural systems
              for decades or even centuries.

        Markets that FAIL cannot SOLVE THE PROBLEMS they generate

    2 examples of how climate change will impact the economy in the near future:
        - Local funds: Threat to local and state governments and their abillity to borrow funds for investment
        - Transporation infrastructure: How coastal level and sea level rise may impact the pacific coast highway in beverly, beach oregon
