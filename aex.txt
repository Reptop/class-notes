Notes from 27 September 2022

Global warming refers the increase in the rise of global average temperature near earth's surface

Climate basics:
    The world has been gettting warmer - the co2 parts per million on our atmopsphere is significantly higher than historic levels.
 
    Another defintion: climate is the expected range of weather for someone living in a specific place
    What is Climate?
        Climate is determined by many factors that influence flows of energy through the climate system, including greenhouse gases.
        Climate change is a change in the pattern of weather - and changes in oceans, land surgaces, and ice sheets, occuring over a large time scale.

    Climate change:
    Climate change is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns. 
    (Climate = distribution of weather outcomes)

    With climate change, we are changing the normal distribution, as the statistical distribution is more saturated in higher temperatures compared to 
    previous data.

    There is not just a shift in the mean, there is also a shift in variance; the distribution are getting smushed down, so more record hot weather is
    very possible. Higher variance equates to greater unpredictabillity - less change for cold weather, but more record hot weather when the mean is shifted,
    but extreme cold and hot weather is still possible because of this increased variance.

    Essentially, this increased variance would lead to more extreme weather outcomes.

    The normal distribution can also be applied to frequency of wildfires, droughts, etc. Temperature isnt the only unit applicable to this normal disribution

Earths warming trend:
    Average temp has risen by 1.53F in last 100 years

    Projected to rise another 2F to 11.5F

Effects of Warming:
    Even small shifts in the mean and variance temperature can lead to a positive feedback loop, which in turn can lead to dangerous shifts in climate and weather

    Examples:
    - More floods, droughts, or intense rain
    - Melting of the polar ice caps
    - Rising see levels
    - Reduce in albedo effect
    - could be more...

IPCC:
    IPCC from the united nations created a model that uses rpc as a metric to detail the intesnity of climate change


Climate views in the united states over time:
    The amount of people that recognize climate change as an issue is rising; however, there are still people who are in disbelief.

"We need to add incentives to become more climate friendly. In an unregulated market nothing alligns self interest with the broader effects of society"

29 September 2022

Current events:
    52 billion dolloar proposal to protect NYC from storm surges

Carbon is an unregulated market; we need policies to make carbon regulated

What is economy:
    A collection of technological, legal, and social arrangments through which individuals in society seek to incnrease their well-being

What is economics:
    The allocation of limited resources (money) to satisfy unlimited human wants
        - The goal of studying economics is just trying to find out how we can do better.

What is climate economics:
    The application of the principles of economics to the study of how environmental and resources are managed.

Big picture questions:
    what is the right price to put on environmental damages that impact our climate?
    What is the best approach to dealing with GHG pollution?
    How do we value ecosystem services harmed by climate change to better inform polcy decisions.

Two systems: economy and the climate
Economy                        climate
 - Economic Agents
    - individuals             - Biosphere
 - Institutions they form
    - Governments, Firms      - atmopsphere
 - Linkages between agents
    -Markets                  - Flora
                              - Fauna
                              - Oceans

Climate change Mitigation:
reducing the flow of heat-trapping grenhouse gases into the atmopsphere
 This can be accomplished by:
    - Reducing the use of fossil fuels
    - Enhancing the capacity of carbon "sinks"

Mitigation policy options (Reducing the flow of GHGs):
    - Market based instruments (M) - Carbon taxes, Subsidies, Cap and trade - can influence innovation in climate friendly instruments (influence the economy)
    - Regulatory instruments (R) - Regulatory efforts, product bans, government investment (For example, a new fuel efficiency standard for cars has been placed) (Creating regulations)
    - Volutary Agreement (V) - Made bewteen a government agency and one or more private parties to acheive environmental objectives or performance

Reducing the use of fossil fuels: 
    - By taxing the use of fossil fuels and using C02 emissions market (M)
    - Improving energy efficiency (R, V)
    - Choosing renewable energy over fossil fuels (M, R, V)
    - Choosing public transport and sustainable mobillity (M, R, V)
    - Promoting sustainable changes in industries (M,R,V)

Enhancing Carbon Sinks:
    - Limiting deforestation (M, R, V)
    - Reducing soil erosion (M, R, V)
    - Habitat restoration in both terrestrial and marine environments (M, R, V)
    - Carbon capturing technology

Other mitigation options:
    - Climate engineering
     - Deliberate and large-scale interventions in climate systems

Climate change adaption:
    Adpapting to actual or expected future climate by taking practical actions to manage risks
    The goal of adaptation is to reduce our vulnerbillity to harmful effects of climate change

Adaption and adaptation types:
    When to adapt?
        - reactive (Response to event of stimulus)
            - Farmer changes crop choice after a drought destroyed crops last year
        - Anticipitory (Actions are taken before impacts are actually observed)
            - government agency providing funding to costal home owners to prevent their homes from being submerged
    Who's doing the adapting?
        - private(Only reacted by an individual and would only benefit that individual)
            - A person in portland buys an AC in response to the rise in temperatures
        - public/joint(actions that create benefits for many individuals at once)
            - engineers nourishes beaches in florida to protect homes and infrastructure from hurricanes and rising sea levels (widening beaches as a protective buffer)

Mitigation and adapting (Using both at the same time!!!!!):
    - Coastal wetland store and sequester lots of Carbon (Mitigation)
    - They defend coasts against sea level rise by buffering storm surges and floodwaters (Adaptation)

5 major challenges:
 - Large Scale & irreversibillity of damages (The large scale and irreversibillity of this issue could make change too late)
                                             (Also when GHGs are realeased in the atmopsphere, they stay for a very long time)

 - Global cooperation (Politcal battles between countries; we need global cooperation for the best policy solutions)

 - intergeneration impacts (its not going away, they want to kick costs in the future, want benefits now)
                           (How can we take into account of the people that aren't born - who are likely to experience severe effects of climate change)

 - Uncertainty (projecting how climate will change and the economics with it, is still quite uncertain in many areas)

 - Unequal distribution of impacts (Success in one place could be damaging to other areas)
                                   (Poorer, Hotter countries are more vulnerable to climate change, and will experience more negative impacts)

scale in terms of economics:
    Economic damage from climate change could reduce global GDP(Gross domestic product) by 7.2% by 2100



-------5 Major challenges expanded:------

irreversibillity:
    (When CO2 enters the atmopshere it stays there for a long time)
    Co2 concentration is largely irreversibile for 1,000 years after emissions stop, locking in:
        - Temperature increase
        - Dry season rainfall reduction
        - Sea level rise
    - Economic damage could reduce global gdp by 7.2% by 2100
Global cooperation:
    GHGs are uniformly-mixed pollutants (Regardless of where they came from, they mix uniformly into the atmopsphere causing problems for all)
    (Countries are doing this to each other in a sense)

    GLOBAL PROBLEMS REQUIRE COLLECTIVE ACTION 

    Because GHGs mix globally in the atmopsphere, damage isnt necessarily attributed to the country where the emissions came from. And expenditures to reduce
    emissions may not benefit the country that is incurring (suffering) them. Therefore, countries may decide to invest in reducing poverty within their borders because 
    spending funds on climate change will make little impact.

    Undeveloped countries are arguing that developed countries have reaped the benefits of co2 emissions are should be responsible in reducing it.

    The threat of climate change isnt as immediate, dense, or recognizable as threats have historically alligned nations behind a common purpose

intergenerational impacts:
    we would rather see the benefits now and pay for it later

    How can we enact policies today to balance the welfare effects of those alive today against the wellfare of future generations?
    (How can we make sure the earth isnt damaged to the point where it will become unlivable for future generations?)

Uncertainty:
    calls for individuals to make decisions with potentially long term consequences, with potentially incomplete knowledge of our climate systems
    We will continue to understand climate science and increases in greenhouse gases; however, there will still be many uncertainties.

    Some main uncertainties:
        - future emissions trajectories
        - future changes in societal preferences
        - modeling limitations
        - measurement error and data
        - feedback systems that could amplify or dampen disturbances in climate systems
Integrated Assessment Models
Uncertainty could work in both directions: it could prove to be less of a disaster than expected or much, much worse.

Unequal distribution of impacts:
    - The poorest countries are experiencing the worst of climate change, which is an issue they were barely responsible for.
    - In a society where global natural resources are shared, people will look out for themselves instead of the common good, which disadvantages marginalized
      groups of people.
    - A study suggests that climate change are increased between-country inequality by about 25 percent.

    The 5 challenges of climate change summarized:
        The effects of climate change is likely to be costly, irreversibile, and unequally distrubted around the plant, and impact current and future
        generations. Defining policy goals must deal with uncertainties in future outcomes and the global nature of the problem

Why is climate change an economic problem???

    (The economy heavily relies on the burning of fossil fuels)
    Much of our economy is based on the combustion of fossil fuels, leading to Co2 emissions in our atmopsphere. This alters earth's climate via 
    the greenhouse effects, which causes feedback loops that can further amplify rising temperatures and effect on humanity. 

    The CORE ECONOMIC problem with greenhouse gas emissions is those who generate the emissions do not pay for the privilege to do so; those that are harmed
    are not compensated. 

    Since the industrial revolution, our atmopshere has been used as a free resource to absorb emissions from industrial activity.

    Using the production of corn as an example:
        When you buy corn, you are paying for the cost to produce it and farmers and retailers are compensated to provide to you - the consumer. However,
        the carbon emissions released to produce that piece of corn is not taken into account of the price of that corn. Economists call these costs 
        externalities, as they are external to the market transaction.

        Externality: Byproduct of market transaction--which is not borne by a third party--and does not participate in that transaction.

        Climate change is an externality and is likely to be the most complex externality that we face because it is global, affecting everyone on the planet,
        the effects are long lived, and that no individual slow the effects of climate change on their own.

        Climate change is an issue for two central economic reasons:
            - its a global externality created by everyday people in their burning of fossil fuels
            - Its a persistent problem that casts a long shadow into the future. The effects of emissions now are likely to affect humans and natural systems
              for decades or even centuries.

        Markets that FAIL cannot SOLVE THE PROBLEMS they generate

    2 examples of how climate change will impact the economy in the near future:
        - Local funds: Threat to local and state governments and their abillity to borrow funds for investment
        - Transporation infrastructure: How coastal level and sea level rise may impact the pacific coast highway in beverly, beach oregon

10 Princibles of economics

    1. People face tradeoffs
        - To get something, we usually have to give up something
            - Ex. Leisure time vs. work

    2. The cost of something is what you give up to get it
        -  Oppurtunity cost is the best alternative forgone
            - The Oppurtunity cost of college is the money you could've made if you used that time to work

    3. Rational people think at the margin:
        - Marginal Changes are small, incremental changes to an existing plan or action
            - Ex. Deciding to produce one more pencil or not
        - people will only take action if the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost

    4. People respond to incentives
        - Incentive is something that causes a person to act
            - Ex Higher taxes on cigars to prevent smoking

    5. Trade can make everyone better off
        - Trade allows countries to specialize in their greater advantages and to enjoy a greater variety of goods and services

    6. Markets are usually a good way to organize Economic Activity
        -  Adam Smith made the observation that when households and firms interact in markets guided by the invisible hand, they will produce the most surpluses for the economy

    7. Governments can sometimes improve economic outcomes
        - For example, when a market fails to partition its resources effectively, governments can step in and intervene to promote greater equity.

    8. The standard of living depends on a countries production:
        - Essentially, the more goods and services a country produces, the higher the standard of living. This is because as more people
        consume a larger quantity of goods and services, their standard of living with increase.

    9. Prices rise when the government prints to much money (inflation)
        - As the government prints more money, there will be a higher demand for goods and services, causing prices to rise 

    10. Society faces a short run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment
        - In the short run, when prices increase, suppliers will want to increase their production of goods and services. In order to achieve this, they need to hire more workers to produce those goods and services. More hiring means lower unemployment while there is still inflation. 
        However, this is not the case in the long-run.


Demand (Consumer side):
    A Demand Curve is a line or curve that represents the maximum amounts of a good people are willing to purchase at a given price

    -----Law of Demand: As price falls, quantity demanded by the consumers rise (Implying a downward sloping demand curve)-----

    What can shift demand:
        Using oranges as an example
        1. Income 
            - More income = increased likelyhood of buying more oranges
            (More income would mean you be fine with buying large quantities of something more expensive)

        2. Tastes and preferences 
            - New cool apple comes around, might just switch from oranges to apples

        3. Price of other goods
            - If the price of a subsititute good like apples is a better value, I'll be more inclined to get oranges

        4. Size of the market
            - if more people moved to my town, stores my sell more oranges at a given price
                (Look at housing prices, more people moving to oregon creates a larger market for housing)

        5. Expecations:
            - If I expect orange crops to get damaged in the future, I may buy more oranges at a given price 

Supply (Producer side):
    A supply curve is how much a firm is willing to sell at a give price for the product
        - Summarizes the relationship between price and quantity on the supply side

    As prices rise, quantity firms are willing to to supply increases
        - As the price of that good increases, there will be more incentive to produce that product for better profits
            (Like in inflation, there will be higher demand of that product if its price rises, but its not sustainable) 

            -------------------As prices increase, quantity supplied will increase-------------------

                                THIS IMPLIES TO UN UPWARD SLOPING SUPPLY CURVE

    Supply and demand create a market. Markets aggregregate the information about suppliers and buyers and signals this information 
    through the equilibirum price that emerges.

Market equilibirum is the intersection of the supply curve, and the demand curve. 
    - Market equilibirum occurs at the price P* and the quantity Q*. This illustrates the concept of economic efficiency.

      Q* is the level of production that maximizes the net benefits to society of this market.

    Need to maximize profits by matching the demand, aiming to not under or over-produce.
Economic Welfare:
    Consumer Surplus (CS):
        The price a consumer is willing to pay minus the price they have to pay

    Producer Surplus (PS):
        the net benefit a producer recieves from participating in this market.
        PS is equal to the price it recieves - minus the cost of producing each unit
    Net benefits:

    CS + PS = Net benefits 

How markets fail:

    Necessary conditions for an efficent market:
        - perfectly competitive market (Lots of buyers, many firms producing identicle products, lots of sellers, free entry and exit into and out of the market, firms are price takers)
        - Perfect information (Buyers and sellers have all the info they need to make economic decisions: Produdct quality, cost, and market prices)
        - Markets are complete (All relevant costs and benefits are borne by the people in that market)
            - Some coffee production has discharged pollution river ecosystems that have been known to damage plant and animal life.
                - if these evironmental costs are not reflected in the price, the coffee market is not complete.

    Complete markets DO NOT EXIST for a number of environmental goods:
        - Air
        - Water
        - ecosystem services
        - ClIMATE

    When any of these 3 conditions does not hold, we can say that this market is not allocating resources effeciently and therefore has failed

For section 3 to hold, we need well defined property rights
Property rights:
    A bundle of entitlements defining the owner's rights, privileges, and limitations for the use of a specific product

    What is a well defined property right?

        1. Universal and comprehensive
            - All resources are privately owned & all entitlements are specified.
        2. Exclusivity:
            - All benefits and cost as a result of owning and using a resource go to the owner either directly or indirectly.
            (An individual should reap all the benefits but also bear all the costs associated with owning a property right)
        3. Transferable:
            - Resource owner can transfer rights to others
        4. Secure and Enforcable
            - No one can take away or use a resource in any away not intended by the owner.

Negative Externality:
    An externality results when the actions of one individual or firm have a direct, unintentional, and uncompensated effect on the well-being
    of other individuals or profits of other firms.

    Prices should reflect the full cost of resource use

    Another definition: When person A's utility (happiness) or production are affected by variables chosen by person B without regard for the effects
                        of person A. (doesnt have to be from a single source) an externality is just any external effect from economic activity.

    Markets with externalities generate costs of 3 types:
        Private costs:
            Costs that show up on profit-loss statements and must be paid by firms (i.e production costs)
            From a consumer perspective: Price you pay to buy something

        External Costs:
            Do not show up on a firm's balance sheet and are not reflected in the price paid by the consumer

        Social Costs:
            Sum of private and external costs

Thursday October 6th:

    Discount rate:
        The discount rate is the rate at which dollars deflate over time.

    Setting the rate:
        Discount rate of 0:
            Present benefits are equally as beneficial in the future

        Low discount rate:

        High discount rate:

        Comparson of equillibria:
            - Electricity output is too high

            - The price of polluting product is too low

            - Too much pollution is produced

            (We need to add policies that account for these low prices for pollution; force pollution price)

Tuesday October 11th:

    Electrification of vehicles:
        Is electrification the answer?

        However...

        broad agreement that EV cars will have a lower lifetime carbon footprint than traditional cigars

        Total emissions per mile in EVs are lower

        1. The batteries in Evs still charged by fossil fuels

        2. EVs.....

        Full benefits of EVs will be realized only after the electricity sources become renewable, and it might take
        decades for that to happen.

        The batteries to create and EVs are an intensive process and create 40% more emissions than a traditional car

        Evs are not the key answer to climate change.

        Evs should be accompanied by use of public transport and bicycles.


    Measuring the economic impacts of climate change:

        Need some kind of government incentive to enact policies.

        Climate impacts:
            Changes in climate affect the physical world

            ........

        Impacts to policy:
            Most climate policies will impose costs on Society (its expensive to manage this issue) 
            (Market based policy would make current goods and services more expensive)
                - develop new technology
                - investments in energy
                - investments in energy efficiency

            Good climate policy depends on our abillity to assess the impacts 

            benefits & costs:
                On one side, we could ban all fossil fuels today, but that destruction and cost that comes with it is immense. 
                 - wars, famine, and chaos would insue since we depend so heavily on fossil fuels.

                 - On the other, we could do nothing and take a gamble on rapidly warming the planet (basically doing nothing, this will cost a lot in the future)

                 ----Sensible policies will thus fall inbetween these two extremes: some balencing of costs and benefits----

            Estimating impacts:

                very difficult to do so...

                Combines uncertainties in emissions projections and climate models with potential range of reactons of human system

            Market impacts in managed systems:

                - market impacts are likely "easiest" to approximate

                - this is true for managed systems in developed Countries

                - These managed systems are more resilient to climate change, gven the time to adapt. 

            Nonmarket impacts and unmanaged systems:

                - most damaging impacts from climate change are likely to arise outside of conventional Markets, with clearly defined prices

                - in unmanagable systems, the scale of the dangers  are likely beyond human capacity to solve

            Climate change and hot, dry summers mean big trouble for Oregon's trees

            Climate change will bring unbalanced economic damage across the US. Some states will benefit from climate change, while others will not.

            Poorer counties are more prone to economic damage. This highlights the importance of adaptation and shows that richer communities are 
            well-equipied to adapt to climate change, given that they have the means to adapt and experience lower losses. 

        Attribution:

            In law, attribution is often associated with responsibility and blame linked to debates about liabillity and compensation
            (Making a link between damages and the person responsible)

            In science, attribution is viewed as a way to further scientific understanding of casual links between elements of the climate system and society

            Attribution: climate v. weather:

            Two examples:
                - Hot weather reduces farm yields
                - small climatic warming may increase farm yields

                   - The difference is that farmers cannot adapt to extreme, unexpected weather while they can adapt to small climatic Changes

                Attribution challenges:
                     - The science is progressing fast and has potential to increase understanding oh how climate change influences economic activity

                     - Over time, some uncertainties will be reduced, while others remain.

                     - We can work now to scientifically verify the damages and losses from certain events 
                    

                    - Currently, we cant say that climate change caused this, it is just one of the causes.

            Attribution of climate impacts must be carefully done; these Assessments must be made scientifically and serparte from the impact from day-to-day
            weather events while also accounting for humans adaptive capacity.
