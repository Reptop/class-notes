  What is art?:
    Random house dictionary defines "art" as the "quality, production, expression, or realm of what is beautiful or of more than ordinary significance."
    Others have defined art as something human-made that combines creative imagination and technical skill, and satisfies an innate desire for order and harmony.

    At various times and places, the complex notion of what is art has little to do technical skill or beauty.

    Also, how we interpret art is greatly influenced by our upbringing, education, gender, race, experiences, and economic status. 

    Works of art do not always have to be created by individuals who percieve themselves as artists, Nor all works produced for an art market. 

  What is art history?
    In art history, historians aim to study art from the perspective of its original context of production and reception (those who formed the origninal audience)

    The work of art historians can be divided into 4 sections:
      1. assessment of physical properties
      2. analysis of visual or formal structure
      3. identification of subject matter or conventional symbolism
      4. integration within cultural context

    Assessing physical properties:
      - The most objective method of study for art historians
      - Requires a close inspection of the work itself
