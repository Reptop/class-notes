  Pay attention to the specific terms used in questions asked in this class
  some questions may be trying to trick you

  Greenhouse Effect:
    First defined in the 19th century:
      First by Joseph Fourier

      Eunice foot and John Tyndall also contributed to research

      lastly, svante Arrhenius put together everything

    The wavelength of radiation emitted by a body depends of the 
    temperature of that body.

    Hotter - shorter wavelength 
    Cooler - Long wavelength

    As a flame gets warmer, the light turns to cooler colors

    The sun emits short wavelength radiation
    the earth emits long wavelength radiation

    most of UV from the sun and space is being absorbed by the ozone layer

    UV is too high in energy, so it is therefore harmful to living organisms

    Earth is trying to release infared energy, trying to cool itself down, but greenhouse gases
    trap in this heat, which keeps the earth warm in temperature.

    SW radiation from Sun absorbed by earth

    Emitted back from earth as LW radiation

    Greenhouse Gases: mostly transparent to incoming SW radiation

    HOWEVER, GHG's strongly absorb outgoing LW radiation emitted by Earth

    Decrease GHG concetration, absorb less outoging LW radiation - planet cools
    (because we're releasing less heat)

    Result: Earth's surgace is ~55 Degrees F (31C) warmer with atmospheric
    GHGs than without

    isotopes: atoms with identical chemical, but different mass

    atmospheric co2 has become more negative (light), so we know that 
    the increase in CO2 is from burning of fossil fuels, not from other
    sources like volcanic activity.

  Earth System Science:

    System - Set of components that interact with one another to operate as a single entity
    Analogy - human body (heart, lungs, brain)

    Change in one component - will affect one or more of other components in some way 

    Result: entire system changes

    Examples (biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere)

    Five compnents of Earth System: 

    solid earth (lithosphere, mantle, core)
    atmosphere
    hydrosphere
    cryosphere
    biosphere.......

  Two major engines of change (regarding greenhouse effect):
    Solar radiation (solar panel on the surface)
    Geo thermal heat (nuclear reactor in the core)


  Energy drives change through convection: transfer of energy, causing motion

  Concvection within solid earth heat supplied from radioactivity

  incoming solar radiation unevenly distributed more energy at equator than poles
  (Less sunlight in areas other than equator, because you're absorbing more sunlight over larger amount of area)
  (Equator is like directly getting hit by the sunlight, so its warmer. The poles are gonna be colder, causing atmosphere)

  atmosphere circulation transfers warm air from the tropics to areas where there are an energy deficit

  Convection in the ocean:
    Dense water sinks, forms deep water...

  Water is being transferred in the tropics to the poles, so the water is being cooled very rapidly - become more dense and sinks

  The oceanic transports heat from the low latitudes to the high latitudes
  ......

  System compnents interact - feedbacks

  Two major feedbacks: (just like in ib bio)
    Positive (changes your equilibrium)
    Negative (brings you back to equilibrium)

    positive feedbacks will amplify the effect of something in a system (for example, the albedo effect)

  more sea ice - more reflection 
  less sea ice - more absorbtion of sea ice

  Currently, there is a reduction in the cryosphere (albedo effect) (bad for the fucking polar bear - best bears god damn)

  2016 reached a record low global sea ice extent 

  The reduction of albedo effect is the main driving force for polar amplifciation

Example of a negative feedback loop that is combatting against reduction in albedo effect: 

  Increased evaporation and cloud formation -> more solar radiation - reduced warming

  Warming from climate change with feedbacks:
    is a lot larger due to positive feedback loops
