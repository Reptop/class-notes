Goal and thoughts on my time in higher education so far (Tuesday October 11th, 2022):

    If I were to think of my all time goal, after spending so much time academia, my top priority would be to become a smart person. At my current state, im
    definitely just a little high school graduate--who worked his way through IB diploma and everything IB; I am currently incomplete. My time through higher
    eeducation has splendid. I met so many people - I found people I love hanging around with: huy, bernardo, the rest of digadam, and I'll likely meet some more 
    people in the near future.  I dont hope to become a genius I once hoped to be, I just hope to push the boundaries I have imposed on myself.

    I do not know how far I can go, so I will go as far as I can - whatever it takes. There is so much I don't know, and yet, so much I want to know. I love that.
